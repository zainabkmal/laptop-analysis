# Data Analysis Project

Overview:
This project involves scraping, cleaning, and analyzing data on laptops from the Jarir website. The goal is to provide insights into various laptop specifications, including RAM, storage, screen size and more. The project showcases my skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and data visualization.

Data Collection (Web Scraping) :
The data was scraped using Python with the following tools:
- BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML.
- Requests for sending HTTP requests.
- Pandas for handling data and saving it to CSV files.

Code Overview:

Data Scraping: Scrapes laptop data including name, brand, and technical specifications from product pages.

Data Cleaning: Processes and cleans the scraped data, organizing technical specifications into individual columns.

Data Export: Saves the cleaned data into CSV files for further analysis.

Data Visualization: The cleaned data was analyzed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as histograms for RAM and storage distributions.


Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python: Core programming language.
- BeautifulSoup: Web scraping.
- Requests: HTTP requests.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization.
- Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization.
